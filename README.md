# Piano

A quick and dirty piano. A lot of features were lost as this has been sitting on a virtual image for a few years... and a lot of things have been updated, causing things to break. Perhaps I will fix them in the future.

Best viewed in Google Chrome. I've not even tried it in another browser.

You can use your keyboard or mouse to hit the keys. If you press `play` a saved MIDI song will play. Can you guess what song it is?
