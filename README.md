# Piano

A quick and dirty piano. A lot of features were lost as this has been sitting on a virtual image for a few years... and a lot of things have been updated, causing things to break. Perhaps I will fix them in the future.

**Best viewed in Google Chrome**. I've not tried it in another browser.

You can use your keyboard or mouse to hit the keys. Click 'Animated tears' if you want to stop the animationos. Click 'Piano key names' to show the key names. If you press `play/pause` a saved MIDI song will play. Can you guess what song it is?
